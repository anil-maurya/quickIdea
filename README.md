# QuickIdea

Swiftly capture and save your ideas.

## Overview

The QuickIdea Chrome Extension is a productivity tool designed to help users capture their ideas conveniently while working on other tasks. It allows users to record their thoughts, tasks, or any inspiration they come across without interrupting their workflow. With a simple keyboard shortcut, users can access the extension, making it easy to capture and revisit their ideas later.

## Problem Statement

Often, while working or reading, we encounter valuable ideas, such as what to read next, important tasks, or creative thoughts. However, if we don't record these ideas immediately, they can be easily forgotten or lead to distractions as we contemplate them. While there are various tools available for note-taking and idea capture, they often require opening a separate application or taking extra steps, which can disrupt the flow of work.

## Features

The QuickIdea Chrome Extension offers the following features:

1. **Convenient Shortcut**: Users can access the extension quickly by hitting the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+0`, ensuring that ideas can be captured with minimal interruption.

2. **Sync with Obsidian**: The extension allows users to sync their recorded ideas with Obsidian, a popular note-taking and knowledge management tool. This ensures that captured ideas seamlessly integrate with their note-taking workflow.

3. **Enhanced Appearance**: The extension includes CSS styling to improve its visual aesthetics, providing users with a more pleasant and user-friendly interface.

4. **Autosizing Dialog**: The dialog box for capturing ideas automatically adjusts in size, accommodating varying lengths of text, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.

5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Future development plans include making the extension a cross-platform application, allowing it to run on different web browsers and operating systems while maintaining its keyboard shortcut functionality.

## How to Use

1. **Installation**: You can install the QuickIdea Chrome Extension directly from the Chrome Web Store.

2. **Keyboard Shortcut**: Once installed, use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+0` to activate the extension and begin recording your ideas.

3. **Capture and Save**: Type or paste your ideas into the dialog box and save them for later reference.
